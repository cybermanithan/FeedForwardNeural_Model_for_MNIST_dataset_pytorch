# FeedForwardNeural_Model_for_MNIST_dataset_pytorch
this is a feed forward neuralnetwork modelfor MNIST dataset made up of pytorch  and this model here gave a accuracy of 99.16166666666666% you can also so improve this by increasing the training loop and more Importent !  run the whole project then go to the training cell to see the model training live
